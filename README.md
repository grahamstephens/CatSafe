## Disclaimers

There is a chance that CatSafe will not run without present .env configs. If that happens, please let us know and we can troubleshoot or give a live demo.

At the point that we got to dealing with npm and different package-lock dependencies it was easier to put everything into a new repo that was specifically designed for a deliverable.
